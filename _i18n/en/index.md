Stimulated by the [International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation 2025](https://www.un-glaciers.org/en), 
the "Goodbye Glaciers !?" project envisions signposts across Europe — from cities to 
mountain areas — pointing to glaciers and displaying the year when they will no 
longer be recognizable under current climate policies. Each signpost includes a 
QR code linking to this website, featuring photos, and three-dimensional 
projections into the future under 1.5°C and 2.7°C global warming. While we must 
say goodbye to many glaciers in Central Europe, ambitious emissions reductions 
can still preserve much glacier volume globally — this is the message we aim to 
share.


Our initiative builds on previous activities and comprehensive knowledge about 
how global warming affects glaciers. It aims to engage the public and 
communicate, in simple terms, which glaciers—particularly in Central Europe—are 
expected to vanish in the coming decades and which might still be preserved by 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and thus, limiting global warming.

The initiative consists of three pillars:
- This website as central communication platform. Start with the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/glaciers/">Glaciers</a> page to explore the key features.
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/signposts/">Signposts</a> to be placed wherever they can interact with people already familiar or not familiar with glaciers
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events/">Public events</a> like exhibitions, guided tours or other activities

We invite everyone to participate in or contribute to this initiative. 
Please find our contacts <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">here</a>.
